# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

An adaptive experiment runner for behavioral research. Researchers define branching, looping, and randomized participant flows as typed TypeScript object literals; the engine renders them as structured multi-screen web studies.

## Stack

- Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5 (strict)
- Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI primitives
- Zustand 5 (experiment state), react-hook-form + Zod (per-screen validation)
- Vitest 4 + happy-dom (unit tests), Playwright (e2e)
- pnpm 9 is the canonical package manager (CI uses it)

## Essential commands

```bash
pnpm dev           # start dev server (runs from repo root)
pnpm build         # Next.js production build
pnpm lint          # eslint (eslint.config.mjs)
pnpm test          # vitest run — all unit tests (engine + frontend)
pnpm test:watch    # vitest — watch mode
pnpm test:e2e      # playwright test — e2e suite
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit across all workspace packages (pnpm -r typecheck)
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
pnpm --filter @experiment-hub/engine exec vitest run specs/conditions.test.ts
pnpm --filter @experiment-hub/frontend exec vitest run src/specs/store.test.ts
```

Vitest accepts a file path or pattern as a positional argument. Test files live under `packages/engine/specs/` (engine) and `apps/frontend/src/specs/` (React components). E2E tests live under `apps/frontend/e2e/`.

## Architecture

This is a pnpm workspace with two packages that must stay decoupled:

```

The flow engine (`packages/engine/`) has no React dependency and is fully unit-tested. The React layer drives it by calling `startExperiment()` once and `traverse(step, formData)` on each screen submission.

## How experiments are defined

All experiments live in `apps/frontend/src/data/experiments/` as entries in the `EXPERIMENTS` record. The `index.ts` file exports the record; each experiment is defined in its own file:

```ts
// apps/frontend/src/data/experiments/index.ts
export const EXPERIMENTS: Record<string, ExperimentFlow> = {
  "my-study": { nodes: [...], edges: [...], screens: [...], options: {...} }
};
```

The route `apps/frontend/app/(experiments-layout)/experiments/[slug]/page.tsx` looks up `EXPERIMENTS[slug]`, calls `validateExperiment()`, and renders `<ValidationErrors>` if any errors are returned — so misconfigured graphs are caught before the participant sees anything.

Start node selection is driven by query-string params: `?condition=A` matches a `StartNode` whose `props.param` equals `{ key: "condition", value: "A" }`. This enables within-experiment condition assignment without separate URLs.

## Non-obvious conventions

**`shouldUnregister: true`** in `apps/frontend/src/Screen.tsx`'s `useForm` call is intentional: unmounted components (those hidden by `conditional`) do not retain their values in the submitted form data.

**`Zustand persist` is not enabled** in `apps/frontend/src/data/store.ts`. Browser refresh resets the experiment. This is a known limitation, not a bug to fix casually — re-enabling it requires implementing session resume logic.

**`send()` in `apps/frontend/src/data/send.ts` is a stub.** `checkpoint` nodes call `send(context)` to persist data — currently a 100ms `setTimeout`. Replace with a real API POST before running participant-facing studies.

**Debug panels are gated behind `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`** (build-time in Next.js production builds). Keep that gate intact when touching `apps/frontend/app/(experiments-layout)/experiments/[slug]/page.tsx` or `apps/frontend/src/Screen.tsx`.

**Option anchoring** — response options accept `anchor: "first" | "last"` to pin specific choices to the ends of a shuffled list. Handled by `shuffleAnchored()` in `packages/engine/utils.ts`.

**pnpm is the canonical package manager.** Always use `pnpm`; the CI pipeline uses pnpm 9 exclusively.

## Anti-patterns

**Do not import React anywhere inside `packages/engine/`.** The engine is deliberately framework-agnostic. Tests in `packages/engine/specs/` run without a DOM renderer. Any React import in that layer breaks the isolation.

**Do not use `$fieldName` references outside `RenderComponent`.** `apps/frontend/src/components/RenderComponent.tsx` merges `form.watch()` into context before resolving props. The engine's `resolve.ts` and condition evaluator never have access to live form state — `$` references in branch conditions or loop `dataKey` fields silently resolve to nothing.

**Do not enable `Zustand persist` without implementing session resume.** Restoring persisted state mid-experiment requires knowing which step to re-enter and which context to restore. It's not a one-line change.

**Do not remove or bypass the `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` guard** on debug panels. In production Next.js builds this dead-code-eliminates the panels; removing the guard exposes raw JSON context to participants.

## Agent workflow

When picking up an issue:

1. Branch from `main` as `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.
2. Implement. Keep changes scoped to the issue.
3. Run `pnpm lint && pnpm test` before committing. Both must pass.
4. Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`.
5. Open a PR against `main` with `gh pr create`, referencing the issue number.
6. CI runs `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e` automatically — both must pass before merge.

**`agents.sh`** at the repo root (untracked; present only in the maintainer's local checkout) is a fan-out script that launches one Claude Code agent per GitHub issue in a tmux grid, each in its own git worktree, for parallel multi-issue development.

**Workspace filter commands**: use `pnpm --filter @experiment-hub/engine <script>` or `pnpm --filter @experiment-hub/frontend <script>` to run scripts in a single package without affecting the other.

## Commit and branch conventions

From git history:
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>` (e.g. `feature/compute-node`, `feature/shared-options`)
- Bug fix branches: `fix/<name>` (e.g. `fix/in-path-stepper`)
- Commit messages use `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:` prefixes for new work; plain imperatives for small changes
- All PRs target `main`
- CI runs `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e` on every PR before merge

## Environment variables

The application reads no environment variables at runtime. The E2E CI job sets `NODE_ENV=test`. There is no `.env.example` or any `process.env` access in the codebase outside the debug-panel guards.

## Sensitive files

Changing these incorrectly breaks participant-facing behavior:

- `apps/frontend/src/data/experiments/index.ts` — the `EXPERIMENTS` dict; removing or renaming a key breaks its route
- `packages/engine/flow/traverse.ts` — the traversal state machine; affects path step counting and all data nesting
- `packages/engine/experiment-validation/` — any regression here silently allows malformed experiments through
- `packages/engine/screen-schema.ts` — `buildSchema()` failing silently disables all per-screen form validation

## Documentation

The `docs/` folder contains precise reference documentation — use it before reading source code for domain questions:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/experiment.md` | `ExperimentFlow` top-level structure |
| `docs/nodes.md` | Node type reference (currently covers 7 of the 9 node types; compute and data are not yet documented) |
| `docs/edges.md` | All edge types and node-to-edge validation rules |
| `docs/components.md` | All component types and their props (content, response, layout, control) |
| `docs/data-keys.md` | The 5 reference prefixes: `$$`, `@`, `$`, `#`, `%` |
| `docs/answer-piping.md` | String interpolation in labels and content (`{{ }}` syntax) |
| `docs/codebook.md` | Auto-generated data dictionary derived from the typed config |
| `docs/i18n.md` | Localized message dictionary and the `[[ ]]` token |
| `docs/validate.md` | All validation error codes with explanations |

## Where to look first

| Question | Start here |
|---|---|
| How the state machine works | `packages/engine/flow/traverse.ts` — `traverse()`, `enterStep()`, `traverseInNode/Path/Loop()` |
| All core type definitions | `packages/engine/types.ts` — `ExperimentFlow`, `State`, `Context`, `FlowStep` |
| What node types exist | `packages/engine/nodes.ts` |
| What validation checks run | `packages/engine/experiment-validation/index.ts` — `validateExperiment()` |
| How a screen form is wired | `apps/frontend/src/Screen.tsx` — `useForm` + `buildSchema` + `buildDefaultValues` |
| How a component gets rendered | `apps/frontend/src/components/RenderComponent.tsx` — switch on `componentFamily` + `template` |
| Where experiments are registered | `apps/frontend/src/data/experiments/index.ts` — `EXPERIMENTS` |
| How a URL maps to an experiment | `apps/frontend/app/(experiments-layout)/experiments/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| Engine behavior examples | `packages/engine/specs/flow/` — traversal tests covering branch, path, loop, fork |
