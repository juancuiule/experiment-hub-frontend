# Nodes

key files: `lib/nodes.ts`

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of an experiment flow. There are a series of node types that can be used to create a flow, and each node type has a specific function. They are connected to each other through edges, which define the flow of the experiment.

All nodes have an id:string and a type:string. The id is a unique identifier for the node, and the type is the type of node it is.

The available types of nodes are:

- `start`
- `checkpoint`
- `screen`
- `branch`
- `path`
- `fork`
- `loop`

Each of those nodes has a specific configuration or series of props.

## Start Node

The `start` node is the entry point of the experiment flow. It is the first node that is executed when the experiment is run. Most experiments will have only one start node, but it is possible to have multiple start nodes if needed to create multiple entry points for the experiment based on url parameters.

To have multiple start nodes one should use the props with `name` (to determine the name of that group) and `param` (to determine the url parameter `key` and `value` that will be used to determine which start node to use). `param` is an object with the keys `key` and `value`.

## Checkpoint Node

The `checkpoint` node is used to save the state of the experiment at a specific point in time. This can be useful to ensure that if a participant leaves the experiment we've already collected some data until that point. It has a `name` prop that is used to identify the checkpoint.

## Screen Node

The `screen` node is used to display a screen to the participant. It has a `slug` prop that is used to identify the screen to be displayed. The `slug` should correspond to a screen that has been defined in the experiment.

Each screen consists of a series of components that are rendered in a specific order. The components can be anything from text, images, videos, or interactive elements like buttons or sliders.

## Branch Node

The `branch` node is used to create a branching point in the experiment flow. It has a `name` prop that is used to identify the branch, a `description` prop that is used to provide a description of the branch, and a `branches` props that is an array of objects that define the different branches that can be taken from this point.

Each branch object has an `id` and a `name` prop that is used to identify the branch, an optional `description` prop that is used to provide a description of the branch, and a `config` prop that is used to configure under which condition the branch should be taken.

The `config` prop is an object with the `ConditionConfig` type that is used to define the condition that must be met for the branch to be taken. The `ConditionConfig` type has three properties: `operator`, `dataKey` and `value`. The `operator` property defines the comparison to apply (see ConditionConfig Operators in the Components section for the full list), the `dataKey` property is a `$$` reference to the data that will be evaluated, and the `value` property is the value that will be compared against it.

If there are multiple branch conditions that are true at the same time, the branch node will take the first one that is defined in the edges array. This means that the order of the edges in the experiment configuration can affect the flow of the experiment.

Branch reconvergence is not required, many branches can lead to different or same nodes but it is not the responsibility of the branch to check that. The connected nodes will determine the flow after the branch node, not the branch node itself.

## Path Node

The `path` node is used to create a path in the experiment flow. It has a `name` prop that is used to identify the path, a `description` prop that is used to provide a description of the path, a `randomized` prop that is used to determine if the path should be randomized or not, and a `stepper` props that allows to configure and optional stepper to be shown at the top of the screen to indicate the progress of the participant in that path.

The only required props is the `name` prop. The stepper configuration is an object with the `StepperConfig` type that has two properties: `label?` and `style`. The `label` property is a string that defines the label to be shown in the stepper, and the `style` property is a string that defines the style of the stepper (e.g. `continuous` or `dashed`). In the label prop `{index}` will be replaced by the current step index, and `{total}` will be replaced by the total number of steps in that path.

## Fork Node

The `fork` node is used to create a fork in the experiment flow. It has a `name` prop that is used to identify the fork, a `description` prop that is used to provide a description of the fork, and a `forks` props that is an array of objects that define the different paths that can be taken from this point. Each fork object is of type `Fork`.

The `Fork` type has an `id` and a `name` prop that is used to identify the fork, an optional `description` prop that is used to provide a description of the fork, and a `weight` prop that is used to determine the probability of that fork being taken. To determine the fork to be taken we should sum the weights of all the forks and then generate a random number based on that distribution.

Fork nodes should not have sequential edges connecting them to other nodes, since the flow after a fork node is determined by the nodes connected fork edges.

## Loop Node

The `loop` node is used to create a loop in the experiment flow. It can be one of two types: `static` or `dynamic`.

The `static` loop node has a `values` prop (string[]) that is used to define the different values that will be iterated over in the loop.

The `dynamic` loop node has a `dataKey` prop that is used to define the key of the data that will be used to determine the different values that will be iterated over in the loop.

Both types of loop have a `stepper?` prop that allows to configure an optional stepper to be shown at the top of the screen to indicate the progress of the participant in that loop. This stepper is exactly the same as the one used in the `path` node, with the same `StepperConfig` type.
